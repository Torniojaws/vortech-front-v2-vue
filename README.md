# Vortech Frontend v2.0

The new frontend for https://vortechmusic.com using Vue.

## Goals

A lot of the features on the current site are unimplemented, and would require heavy changes.
So to bring it up to speed, Vue will be used and the site will be built from the ground up
using the classic(?) mobile-first approach.

## Docker

At some point, use Docker for easier deployment.
